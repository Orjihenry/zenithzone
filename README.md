## Motivation Behind This Project

I set out to build this real estate listing platform to reduce the dependency on middlemen in the property market—especially in Nigeria, where inflated agent fees and lack of transparency are common challenges. By enabling direct listings and allowing users to manage their own property data, this project empowers both property owners and seekers with greater control, clarity, and cost-efficiency in their transactions.

Additionally, as a new Get-Building student, this project provides a hands-on opportunity to apply what I’m learning, enhance my technical skills, and gain experience by building practical, real-world solutions that matter.
